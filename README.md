training analysis for behavioral experiments

Each .py file should be in the same directory as an "input" folder.

The "input" folder should contain a sub-folder, with subject's name,
such that animals A1, A2, etc. training with a particular protocol each 
has a folder with its raw .mwk datafile.

EX: "analysis" folder contains .py analysis scripts with "input" folder containing subfolders (A1, A2, etc.) for each animal. This is where that animal's .mwk data files go. Can also have an "output" folder with corresponding subfolders for each animal's summary stats.
